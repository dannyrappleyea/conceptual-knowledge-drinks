# conceptual-knowledge-drinks
This is a knowledge repository of alcoholic drinks in [conceptual knowledge](https://github.com/digitalreplica/conceptual-knowledge/blob/main/concept/conceptual%20knowledge.md) format. It's a template to start your own drink knowledge database.

## Using this template
- Clone this repository or download a zip file and open it in your notes application
- Create folders for the different types of drinks (beer, cider, etc).
- Create a note for each drink, brewery, etc
	- Names often duplicate, so it's recommended to add the brewery or distillery in parentheses like `Stout (Foothills Brewing)`
	- Beer and cider types generally follow [Untappd](https://untappd.com/) guidelines
